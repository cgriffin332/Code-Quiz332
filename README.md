# Code-Quiz332

## Description 

For this project I have created a timed multiple choice code quiz for a juxtaposition of JavaScript review and some fun.  This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML, CSS and Bootstrap powered by JavaScript. This also features clean user interface that will adapt to multiple screen sizes.

The code quiz begins when the start button is pressed. The timer begins and the first multiple choice quiz question is shown.

When the user clicks their answer, the user is notified if their choice was correct and the next quiz question is displayed. If the user's response is incorrect, the timer is lowered by 10 seconds.

When the user answers the final quiz question or when the timer reaches 0, the game is over. The user is shown their score and they can save their initials to the Highscore page.

You are then shown the highscores page where it lists the user's highscores.

The user can press the "clear" button to clear highscores, or can press the "go back" button to try the quiz again.
